Description
Prototype of Chicago Veg Meetup Restaurant finder
This is a prototype code I made for the Chicago Veg Meetup group and it is still in progress. It used to give direction from an address to a restaurants. There are some bugs like the map does not update the markers properly and I have not done a rigorous code review and clean-up. Nevertheless, it does illustrate my front-end approaches like:

- ViewModel independence from View
- How I wrap third party libraries
- Common JavaScript libraries I am familiar with and used


Requirements

Visual Studio 2013 express or higher. There is no backend, so SQl Server is unneccessary
